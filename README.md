# Framingham-Heart-Study
Internet of Things Simulation Applied to The Framingham Heart Study. (Application Engineering and Development)
## Synopsis

The Framingham Heart Study is a world famous institute that tracks heart disease in a population of 5000 people with their children and grand-children. All of the world-wide advances in the prevention of heart-disease are the result of this study.We develop qualify-of-life metrics that will speak to cardiac health of individuals.Assumption is that individuals, children, and grand-children will use their mobile devices to record their lifestyle and environmental conditions in their surroundings. The first measurements to include will be the vital signs of the individuals in the study and assume that will be automatically recorded though the individualâ€™s mobile device. Calculation of risk score has also been done (Ref:  <a href="https://www.cvdriskchecksecure.com/framinghamriskscore.aspx">Framingham Risk Score</a>.)
